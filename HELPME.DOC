ZZT  version 3.1                      *           Troubleshooting & Hints
==============================================================================

DESCRIPTION.
============

     ZZT is a new action/adventure game based on object-oriented programming.
To complete Town of ZZT,  you must master 43 game boards filled with creatures
and ingenious puzzles.  The game is very challenging and requires a good amount
of brain power as well as fast reflexes.

     ZZT includes a game editor so you can create your own game worlds using
a set of ready made objects.  You can also write small programs to control
objects using the built in ZZT-OOP programming language.

SPECIFICATIONS:
===============

     ZZT requires a PC compatible computer with at least 512k RAM and any
graphics adapter with a color or monochrome screen.  Keyboard,  Joystick and
Mouse operation are fully supported.

HINTS:
======

 - When you discover a new object,  try touching it.  Nearly everything has
   some sort of purpose (but watch out for red herrings!)

 - Remember that you can often exit the room you are in by moving off
   the screen.

 - Save the game often.  Then if you get killed you can just restore
   the game and continue on without penalty.

 - Don't feel overwhelmed.  You can expect to play ZZT a total of about
   20 hours before you finish the game.  It is well worth the effort and
   you can always take your journey one step at a time.

     INTRODUCTION.

          Before we get into the serious stuff,  let me tell you a little
     story.  I've been into computers for the last 10-15 years and have
     seen my share of PD or Shareware games.  Until I ran across ZZT on
     Delphi, I had never been so taken with a game.  Even KROZ,  which is a
     fine game, got boring after a while.

          So what made me go nuts over ZZT?  First,  it is a very well-
     written game.  Second,  Town of ZZT had me sitting up nights trying to
     figure out the puzzles,  where other games are more of a "shoot
     everything that moves" type.  Third, very few games allow you to
     create your own puzzles;  even fewer give you a chance to have your
     creations published.

          Anyway, I registered for ZZT almost immediately.  On the comment
     card that Tim sends out with the registered copy of the program,  I
     wrote him a note asking if he had ever thought of a complete hint file
     for ZZT.  The rest is history.  By the way, Tim...  Can I be listed as
     "staff" now?  [Sure thing,  Dave.  You are now the Official ZZT
     Advisor.  -TIM]

     GENERAL HINTS.

          ZZT has a great save-game feature...  Use it often.  That way, if
     you die or get stuck, you can go back to your last saved game instead
     of starting over.

          Try anything!  In finishing Town of ZZT,  I did some things that
     I didn't expect to have to do.  Sometimes the strange thing is the
     right thing.  The worst that can happen is death,  and...  You did
     save your game,  didn't you?

          Save torches and ammo as much as possible...  You never know when
     you'll need them.

          If you're really stuck,  quit for a while.  No sense getting more
     and more frustrated.  Two puzzles in Town (The Rube Board and The
     Throne Room) took me almost a week to solve...  A week EACH, that is!

     SPECIFIC ROOM HINTS.

          Note:  Not all rooms have identifiable names.  I have made every
     attempt to identify the rooms clearly.

          Opening Room:  Choose a path, any path. One way of dying is as
                         good as another.

                Armory:  Why bother the Vendor when the key to the stock
                         room is right here?  There are even two ways to
                         get it.

                  Bank:  The combination is hidden somewhere in the game.
                         A friend in a bad spot can help you find it.

        Path to Castle:  Better go around the back way to get the key.
                         Just don't get shot.

        Outside Castle:  Can't kill the troll,  may as well bribe him.

         Inside Castle:  Grab those torches,  the labyrinth is dark!

             Labyrinth:  Yellow gets Blue, Blue gets White, White gets
                         Purple. Too bad it isn't really that easy.

     Room of Annoyance:  There are two ways in;  use them both. And don't
                         bump your nose too many times.

         Dragon's Lair:  Feel free to re-arrange the yellow bombs.

           Throne Room:  You'll need all 3 keys. You have to block a door
                         open to get the sceptre.

       The Three Lakes:  Put your running shoes on!

        The Rube Board:  MOST of the hints in the board are correct...
                         Which ones are wrong?

              Bug Maze:  Walk softly and carry a big can of bug spray.

        Outside Prison:  The guard will let you in, just ask! When you get
                         out, right first!

         Inside Prison:  Move quick... you only have a short time! Don't
                         forget the key!  And convicts sometimes have
                         interesting stories to tell.

     "Here It Is" Room:  Better save first, this one is deadly.  Try moving
                         the bombs.

       Sliding Puzzle:   Don't block off something you might need later.
                         You'll need to use the small passage on the right
                         side,  too.

           Think Fast:   Better shoot fast,  too!

         Path by Cave:   Nothing much exciting here.

           The Forest:   Use the Energizers wisely.

          More Forest:   Be glad there's a shortcut on the way out.

       House of Blues:   Sing the Blues Man a song. Watch the notes!

            The Mixer:   The surgeon general has determined that entering
                         The Mixer while the lions are alive is definitely
                         hazardous to your health.

        Inside Palace:   Go right first.

            Last Room:   (Dark room in the palace)  Don't go rushing in...
                         Get the boulders out of the way first.
