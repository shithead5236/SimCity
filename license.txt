Program only in accordance with the following terms and
conditions (the "General Terms and Conditions") and with other
terms and conditions set forth below that may be applicable:

1.    Epic hereby grants You a limited right to use the
Program for Your gaming enjoyment.  You acknowledge that the
Program is a valuable asset of Epic and Epic is the owner of
the Program. Enjoy! 

2.	Epic MegaGames, Inc. shall be credited as the owner of
the Program, in any and all packaging, documentation,
catalogs, program descriptions, advertising, promotion and
public relations relating to the distribution of the Program
as well as the actual distribution of the Program (the
"Distribution").
	
3.	The Program shall be identified by name and shall not
be identified or described as "freeware", "public domain
software", or the like in any Distribution.
	
4.	You may copy and/or distribute the Program only in
its original, unaltered form, with all files included
unmodified, and without making any additions, modifications or
deletions except as provided in this paragraph.  You may not
modify the Program or any of its files, and the Program must
be distributed as a complete package. You may not change,
delete, merge or rename any files or elements of the Program
in any manner, and You may not add any files or new elements
(except for installation routines which do not interfere with
the proper operation or installation of the Program).
	
5.	You may not decompile, recompile, disassemble, reverse
engineer, adapt or create derivative works of the Program or
any files or elements thereof .  You may not use the artwork
from the Program without Epic's prior written permission.

costs associated with distributing the Program.  You are

the Program to Your friends, family members and co-workers

or recipient.  (By way of illustration and not limitation, if
You distribute the Program at a charge of $8.00 for disks and
$4.00 for shipping and handling (for a total of $12.00), You
shall pay Epic a royalty of $1.50 with respect to each user
or recipient.)  In the event that such a royalty is payable to
Epic, You shall provide Epic with quarterly statements of
account setting forth the royalty owed in reasonable detail,
accompanied by payment thereof; and Epic or its designee shall
have the right to inspect and audit Your books and records
from time to time to verify the amounts of the royalties due
Epic hereunder.  You must notify Epic in writing before You
undertake any Distribution of the Program for which You plan
on charging or do charge end users of the Program a fee.

trademark information on the Program, and You must take
reasonable steps to protect the copyrights, trademarks and
other rights of Epic in the Program.
	
9.	You recognize that Your right to distribute the
Program is nonexclusive and that Epic can terminate the
license granted to You hereunder at any time for any reason
upon written notice. Epic reserves the right to withhold or
withdraw permission to distribute the Program from anyone at
any time for any reason.You acknowledge that You have no
reasonable basis or expectation to make a profit regarding the
Distribution of the Program.  The provisions of paragraphs 4,
7, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21 and 22 hereof shall survive any
expiration or termination of this Agreement.

the Program and any other software, documentation and other
materials distributed with the Program are free from viruses
or other harmful programs or routines.
